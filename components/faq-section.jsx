    question: "How do I post a listing on Homie?",

      "It's very simple! Create an account, click 'Post a listing', add photos and a description of your property, set the price and availability. Your listing will be live within minutes after verification.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the fees for owners?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Are payments secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all payments go through our secure platform. Funds are held until check-in confirmation, then released to the owner. In case of disputes, our team intervenes to find a solution.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the damage insurance cover?",
    answer:
      "Our included insurance covers material damage up to $5,000 per rental. It protects owners against accidental damage. A $200 deductible applies in case of a claim.",

  {
    question: "Can I cancel a reservation?",
    answer:
      "Cancellation conditions are set by each owner (flexible, moderate, or strict). Refunds are calculated based on these conditions. Force majeure cases may qualify for a full refund.",
